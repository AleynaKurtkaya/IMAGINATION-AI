# IMAGINATION-AI
-Graduation Project 2 - 

Hi!

"ImagiNation" is a unique project that aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence to create an engaging visual experience for children through AI-generated imagery and storytelling.The project utilizes large language models such as OpenAI to create captivating story texts for children, and generates images for these texts with artificial intelligence such as DALL-E. The goal is to stimulate children's imagination and creativity while making learning enjoyable.

A platform was created for this project. This platform can allow children aged 7-13 and parents to create stories with appropriate content and also provide eye-catching visuals for these stories. Children and parents can be able to create their own stories using this platform and interact with artificial intelligence technologies. This approach enables the project to reach a wider audience and provide a unique educational experience. Key benefits of "ImagiNation" include expanding children's imaginations, contributing to their learning processes through educational stories and images, and offering personalized learning experiences. However, potential drawbacks, such as excessive internet addiction, limited creativity, and content quality issues, must be considered and addressed by ensuring parental supervision and maintaining high content standards.

"ImagiNation" represents an innovative approach to children's education and entertainment, combining AI-driven narratives with images to create a new world of learning possibilities.

We would like to thank Professor Doctor H.Kemal Ä°lter, who mentored and supported us in this project.
